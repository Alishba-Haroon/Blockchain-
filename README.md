This code demonstrates a simple blockchain implementation using Python and Flask. The blockchain is a distributed ledger system where data is stored in blocks, which are linked together in a chain. The core concept is that once a block is added, it cannot be altered, ensuring data integrity.

Key Components:
Blockchain Class:

Chain Initialization: The blockchain is initialized with an empty list, and the first block (genesis block) is created.
Block Creation: Each block contains an index, timestamp, proof (a number that ensures the block is valid), and a reference to the previous block's hash.
Proof of Work: This mechanism is used to secure the blockchain by requiring miners to solve a computational puzzle (finding a valid proof) before adding a new block.
Block Hashing: Each block is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm, which provides a unique identifier for the block.
Chain Validation: The integrity of the blockchain is checked by ensuring that each blockâ€™s previous hash matches the hash of the previous block, and that the proof of work is correct.
Flask API Endpoints:

Mine Block: Mines a new block by solving the proof of work and adds it to the blockchain.
Get Chain: Returns the entire blockchain.
Validate Chain: Checks if the blockchain is valid by verifying the consistency of the blocks.
